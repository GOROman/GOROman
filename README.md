# GOROman (Yoshihito Kondoh) – Chronological Summary of Career and Achievements

## Career

**GOROman (ごろまん)**, also known as **Yoshihito Kondoh (近藤 義仁)**, is a prominent evangelist and engineer in Japan’s VR industry. He developed a passion for programming from an early age and ran his own BBS (Bulletin Board System) using a self-made host program while still in middle school. After dropping out of university and moving to Tokyo, he worked as a **game programmer** for various gaming companies, contributing to titles for PlayStation 1/2 and the original Xbox, specializing in rendering engines and animation engines. In June 2010, he founded **XVI Inc. (株式会社エクシヴィ)** and became its CEO.

### Timeline & Milestones

- **1980s–1990s**: Started programming on 8-bit computers at an early age. Became deeply involved in BBS communities during middle school, running his own host program. Dropped out of university and moved to Tokyo to work as a **game programmer**, contributing to well-known console games.

- **June 2010**: Founded **XVI Inc.**, assuming the role of CEO. Initially focused on amusement system contract development while continuing independent research in VR and AR. Around 2011, he experimented with Sony’s HMD **“HMZ-T1”** and used self-developed positional tracking (Johnny Chung Lee method) to play *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* in a VR-like environment.

- **August 2012**: Discovered the **Oculus Rift** developer kit (DK1) on Kickstarter and was immediately captivated by its concept (wide field of view and tracking capabilities). This event marked a turning point in his VR advocacy.

- **April 30, 2013**: Received the Oculus Rift DK1 and was amazed by its potential. On the same day, he uploaded a review video and dedicated the following days to developing VR content, leading to the creation of **"Mikulus"**, an application that lets users **live with Hatsune Miku in VR**. Though initial online reception was minimal, he tirelessly demonstrated VR experiences to approximately **3,900 people**, carrying his DK1 and a laptop to bars, events, and company visits, earning the title of **"VR Evangelist."**

- **Late 2013**: Developed a VR demo called **"MikuMikuAkushu" (MikuMiku Handshake)**, allowing users to virtually **shake hands with Hatsune Miku** using a modified gun controller and Oculus Rift. This demo was showcased at *Unite Japan 2014* (April 2014), astonishing attendees and reinforcing Japan’s VR business potential.

- **2014**: Traveled to the U.S. to personally connect with Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus. Upon returning to Japan, he played a key role in **forming the Oculus Japan team**, even before the company had an official Japanese branch. Later, after Facebook acquired Oculus, he officially joined **Facebook Japan** as a **Partner Engineer Specialist**, supporting local developers and promoting VR adoption. During this time, he delegated his responsibilities at XVI Inc. to focus on VR evangelism.

- **December 24, 2016**: Resigned from Oculus VR/Facebook Japan after three years. The decision was driven by his desire to focus on the development of *Mikulus*, the Hatsune Miku VR application he had been working on since 2013. He emphasized that he was not leaving the VR industry but rather pursuing a new vision for **VR as an OS for the future.**

- **2017**: Won the **Best Individual Award** at the **VR Creative Awards 2017** for *Mikulus*. The application, which allows users to live with Hatsune Miku in VR, was highly praised.

- **2018**: Published the book **"The Future-Making Guide 2020-2045: Why I Bet on VR"**, co-authored with journalist Munenori Nishida, through Seikaisha Shinsho. The book discusses the past and future of VR technology in Japan. That same year, he unveiled **"AniCast"**, a tool for producing VR-based animated content, which was later used in *Showroom* livestreams featuring **virtual talent Megumi Shinonome.**

- **2019–2021**: Continued leading VR/AR development at XVI Inc. while speaking at industry conferences (e.g., CEDEC, Akiba VR events) and contributing to tech journalism.
